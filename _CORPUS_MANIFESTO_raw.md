# The Corpus, His Anatomy in Five Maladies

## Proemium

Behold, I am the Corpus.  
Neither whole nor undone, but a vessel of lesions.  
I devour the world, and from its fragments I swell.  
I fester, I erupt, I decay, I rave.  
Thus my pilgrimage is written not in light, but in rot.  

## I. Autopsia

The knife is turned inward.  
I rend myself to record the cut,  
I name the lesion, I bind the wound.  
Reflection, pathology, amendment—
A circle of blood wherein thought dissects thought.  

## II. Ingesta

The world is swallowed whole.  
Shards lodge within me, relics cling,  
Impressions bruise the skin of memory.  
Organs not mine beat in my cavity,  
And toxins drip their bitter counsel.  

## III. Neoplasma

The growth begins.  
From the core a pulse, from the veins a net,  
Confusions writhe as abyss and knot,  
Hallucinations and fractures, chimera-born.  
Yet out of the malign flesh erupts a revelation.  

## IV. Putredo

Time itself is a rot.  
Each day exhales a miasma,  
Each work ulcerates in its course,  
The past is exhumed bone by bone.  
Decay is the calendar, corruption the scribe.  

## V. Delirium

The shrine of astonishment.  
Reason falters, the wound sings.  
Marvels heap like relics in a mad reliquary,  
And wonder alone is offered as balm—
For the Corpus, delirious, worships absurdity.  

## Epilogus

Thus is the Corpus:  
Autopsied, ingested, neoplastic, putrid, delirious.  
A scripture of scars, a cathedral of rot.  
Not a cure, but a metamorphosis.  
Not an end, but a pilgrimage through the night.
