# **VIGIL**

> *To write is to remain awake among the dead.*

## I. The Watcher Between Pulses

**Vigil** is the chamber where thought does not labour, but endures.  
No incision, no analysis — only the trembling act of recording that the self has not yet dissolved.  
Here, language is not the scalpel, but the faint breath fogging the mirror.  

Each entry in *Vigil* is a heartbeat under the weight of entropy.  
To write here is to testify that the decay continues — and so do you.

## II. The Function of Vigil

Use this layer to inscribe the remnants of days that refuse to vanish.  
Not observations, not conclusions, but **continuations**.  
It is the proof of consciousness persisting in exhaustion,  
the faint light sustained for no reason but its own defiance.

Write of:
- the moment between collapse and continuation,  
- the noise that remains after meaning,  
- the pulse that refuses to synchronize with order.  

Vigil accepts both coherence and delirium,  
for both are symptoms of endurance.

## III. Closing Litany

When the world sleeps, the Corpus still murmurs.  
Each Vigil written is a breath stolen from extinction.  
And though no reader will come —  
the record remains, the candle guttering in the void.

*Thou remainest awake; therefore, thou art still rotting beautifully.*
