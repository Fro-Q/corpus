*What lesion festers as a project—*
*what wound demands tending, yet resists closure?*  

---

*Which tools, incisions, or neglects shape its course:*
*to suppurate, to scar, or to consume the flesh entire?*  

---

*How shall this ulcer be tracked—*
*by the seepage it leaks, by the labour it devours,*
*or by the silence it leaves?*
