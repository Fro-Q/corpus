*From which slit of my own flesh does this tremor of thought bleed?*  

## a Milestone

Corpus is now at a milestone.

6 layers, a bit exaggerated, but loosely coupled, quite good.

### `Autopsia`

`Autopsia` is kinda self-autopsy, introspection, reflection.
Mainly cognitive autopsy, can be understood as metacognition.

It has 3 sub-layers, or 3 stages of a single autopsy should I say.

#### `Incisio`

A cut, a slit.
A first cut into a cognitive phenomenon, an initial observation.
Note the **observation**, means no judgment, no analysis, just a cut and a look.

Here for example, I made a cut into Corpus itself.

#### `Pathologia`

Now comes the analysis to the cut, the pathology.
Judgments is made here, and maybe hypotheses too.

#### `Satura`

And finally the stitching back, the suture.
Decision has to be made here, how to deal with the pathology found.

So a new cognitive pattern is formed here, a new habit maybe.

It's a full cycle of introspection, from observation, analysis to decision.

### `Ingesta`

`Ingesta` is about information intake, or information diet,
with no judgment, no analysis, just intake.
It's like eating, just eat whatever is there.

5 sub-layers here.

#### `fragmenta`

Might be misleading, `fragmenta` does not mean fragmented information.
It specifically refers to "stimulating" information,
i.e. information that triggers strong emotional reactions,
or strong cognitive shocks.

#### `Reliquia`

`Reliquia` is about "relic" information,
not means outdated, but rather "strongly comfirmed" information.
Information that has been verified, cross-checked, and confirmed multiple times.
Or some simple truths that are self-evident.

#### `Impressio`

The information is "impressed" into memory
in the process of intaking, experiencing and practicing.

#### `Organon`

`Organon` is the structure and logic of information.
But don't be misled, it's not about connections between information,
but rather the internal structure of a single piece of information.
Still atomic, not molecular.

#### `Toxicon`

So it's simply a failure log.
Kinda hard to say if it's just a special kind of `Impressio`,
however recorded separately because I think failure is great.

### `Neoplasma`

`Ingesta` is all about intake without judgment,
while `Neoplasma` is the part of judgment, analysis and synthesis of information.

4 sub-layers.

#### `Cor`

The heart, the core of thought.
Ontology.

#### `Vascula`

The vessels, the connections between thoughts.
Examples can be group meetings, MOC of projects, and so on.

#### `Oblivium`

Like questions, doubts, unconprehended phenomena.
6 types of oblivium:
`Abyssus` - anxiety of being.
`Nodus` - confusion of logic and causality.
`Kallucina` - cognitive dissonance.
`Fluxux` - emotion turmoil.
`Fractura` - measurement error.
`Chimera` - modeling and abstraction failure.

#### `Eruptio`

Of course there should be moments of epiphany,
moments of sudden clarity and insight.
This is it.

### `Putredo`

`Putredo` is the decay, the rot, the corruption of thought.
Actually it's not necessarily bad,
because decay is part of the life cycle.
So it is just somewhere to record things in the timeline.

#### `Miasma`

Like a daily log, but not necessarily daily.
Just a timeline of thoughts, events, and so on.

#### `Ulcus`

Should be considered as a `Miasma` in another dimension.
Like a `Miasma` of a specific topic, or a specific project.

#### `Exhumatio`

A review of past thoughts, events, and so on.
Like a retrospective, or post-mortem.

### `Delirium`

Simple, some aesthetic stuff.
I don't have to be rational all the time.

### `Vigil`

`Vigil` is like a diary, or night journal.
Day is for rational thinking, night is for some wild thoughts.
Not that wild, just something more free.

*What hidden rot festers beneath the veneer of consciousness,*
*unseen yet palpable?*  

## What's Wrong

I would say nothing is wrong, everything is fine.

It is a bit complicated, but I think it should function well.

---

*Which shard of perception pierces, corrupts,*
*or mocks the clarity I seek?*
