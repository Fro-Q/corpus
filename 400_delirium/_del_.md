# **Delirium**

> *The Shrine of Astonishment, where Reason is shattered and Wonder becometh tyrant.*

## I. The Cabinet of Madness

Here standeth the Corpus’ final chamber,  
where reason stumbleth into ruin  
and thought cracketh upon its own delirium.  
Marvels heap like relics in a reliquary of lunacy,  
fragments that both ignite and dismember the mind.  

## II. The Treasury of the Extraordinary

Here are gathered the artifacts that bewilder and ravage:  
objects that quake against the skull,  
not for their logic but for their delirious impact.  
Every sensation is a tremor,  
every notion an ecstatic wound  
inscribed upon the Corpus’ fevered flesh.  

### **Delirium**, the Tremor

Here the mind itself is a quaking vessel,  
the heart a drum for absurd revelations.  
No order is preserved—only rupture and astonishment,  
a carnival of cognition unbound.  

## III. A Warning to the Pilgrim

Beware the reliquary of marvels.  
For delirium revealeth, yet also consumeth.  
Gaze, tremble, adore—  
but return to the flesh ere thy spirit drown  
in the endless cataract of wonder.

*Thou art both collector and collected,*  
*both witness and wonder.*
