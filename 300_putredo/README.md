# **Putredo**

> *Time itself is a wound that rotteth slowly, and the Corpus is its suppurating archive.*

## I. The Calendar of Decay

Each day exhaleth its miasma,  
each hour ulcerateth in secret.  
Time loopeth not as order but as putrescence,  
where memory itself is a grave exhumed without end.  
History becometh both tomb and tutor,  
etching its lessons in carrion script.  

## II. The Triptych of Corruption

### **Miasma**, the Daily Vapor

The day exhaleth fatigue and dread.  
Breaths hang as vapors of despair,  
a diary written in gas and stench.  
Thus existence beareth witness to its own vanishing.  

### **Ulcus**, the Project Ulcer

Every work suppurateth,  
every task is a lesion fermenting slowly.  
The ledger of effort is a hospital of rot,  
where progress itself becometh affliction.  

### **Exhumatio**, the Unearthing

Here the bones of past endeavor are raised.  
Revisions awaken like corpses clawing from the earth,  
each reflection both revelation and corruption.  
The archive is a necropolis,  
every insight dug from soil black with putrefaction.  

## III. An Admonition from the Necrotic Archive

Beware the intoxication of rot.  
Decay is a teacher, yet too much inhalation consumeth.  
Inhale sparingly, stitch thy ulcers,  
then close the grave lest the living be dragged below.

*Thou art both cadaver and chronicler,*  
*both putrescence and pen.*
