# **Neoplasma**

> *Growth without measure, form without design; the Corpus begetteth its own deformity and calleth it truth.*

## I. The Aberrant Genesis

Neoplasma is the unlawful genesis within the Corpus.  
A will to multiply heedless of command,  
a bloom that devoureth its own soil.  
What is born is not birth but insurgency,  
a tissue that crowneth chaos as its king.  

## II. The Four Movements of Proliferation

### **Cor**, the Core

A false myocardium, thudding without cadence.  
Its rhythm sustaineth not life, but persistence alone—  
a metronome of derangement,  
a parody of eternity in meat.  

### **Vascula**, the Vessels

A labyrinth of vessels knotted and obscene.  
They feed ulcer and sprout alike,  
granting vigor to lesion and delirium.  
Here the network itself becometh the pathology,  
a circulatory heresy that serveth only its own tangle.  

### **Oblivium**, the Chamber of Forgetting

A necrotic womb wherein memory is excised.  
Here arise six abhorrent lobes:  

- **Abyssus**, *Lesion of Infinite Depth*  
  - A pit without floor, perception plummets into vertigo.  

- **Nodus**, *Fibrotic Knot*  
  - Thought strangleth itself into paralysis.  

- **Hallucina**, *Phantom Growth*  
  - A spectral organ projecting false lights to blind its bearer.  

- **Fluxus**, *Unstable Torrent*  
  - Flesh without walls, a torrent that is its own dissolution.  

- **Fractura**, *Fractured Cortex*  
  - Models shatter like brittle glass,  
    severing both surgeon and subject.  

- **Chimera**, *Hybrid Mass*  
  - Irreconcilable tissues welded in grotesque congress.  

### **Eruptio**, the Revelation

A terminal rupture, a convulsion of abomination.  
From the tumor bursts no healing flame,  
but a blaze of annihilation,  
illumining the void for but a heartbeat,  
ere it collapses into deeper necrosis.  

## III. The Surgeon’s Warning

Thou canst not excise what is thy marrow.  
The Corpus itself is both seed and soil  
for every monstrous blossom it begetteth.  
To deny the neoplasm is to amputate thyself;  
to embrace it is to be devoured.

*Thou art the womb and the wound,*  
*the mutation and the mirror.*
