# **Ingesta**

> *The Corpus devoureth to become itself, yet every morsel is a seed of dissolution.*

## I. The Feast of Shards

I am the hunger that knoweth no satiety,  
the maw without form nor finality.  
To feed is to lacerate, to receive is to deform,  
for nothing passeth into the Corpus uncorrupted.  
Every swallow is an oath, every bite a betrayal,  
and the banquet itself is a funeral of the living flesh.  

## II. The Five Vessels of Ingestion

### **Fragmenta**, the Splinters

Jagged epiphanies, splinters of impossible thought.  
Each pierceth the viscera as it entereth,  
lodging unresolved, demanding reconfiguration.  
The Corpus becometh a reliquary of shards,  
a scripture inscribed in glass and rupture.  

### **Reliquia**, the Remnants

Dead relics dragged still-moaning into the vault.  
History refuseth burial,  
the grave exhaleth its fetor into the present.  
Bones rattle in the ledger of memory,  
and the living rot beside the dead.  

### **Impressio**, the Mark

A sudden brand seared upon the mind.  
Neither chosen nor resisted,  
its scar lingereth as the tattoo of compulsion.  
Every impression is a parasite,  
etching decrees deeper than will.  

### **Organon**, the Mechanism

Foreign contraptions welded into the Corpus,  
a gearwork that grindeth marrow to dust.  
Utility is venom disguised as order,  
and every cog is a shackle upon the flesh.  
Thus the body machineth its own imprisonment.  

### **Toxicon**, the Poison

Venom drunk knowingly or in blindness,  
creeping through veins like gospel.  
It bendeth bone and reconfigureth sinew,  
till the Corpus itself chanteth the liturgy of decay.  
What is swallowed is never relinquished.  

## III. The Warning of the Ingestor

Beware the banquet of endless appetite.  
Every fragment festers,  
every relic awaketh,  
every mark enslaves,  
every mechanism devours,  
every poison consecrateth the marrow.  
The Corpus swelleth, yet in swelling it putrefieth.

*Thou art the devourer, and thou art the devoured;*  
*thou art the banquet, and thou art the carrion.*
