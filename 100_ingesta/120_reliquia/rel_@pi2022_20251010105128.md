-->

### Points

- [GLAKES](https://garslab.com/?p=310&lang=zh-hans)
  - global lakes (and reservoirs)
  - min area 0.03 $km^2$
  - 3.4 million more
- dynamics of lake area over 35 years (1984-2019)
- small lakes important

### Procedure

- [U-net](#u-net)
- Landsat
- 1984-2019

### Deeper

#### U-Net

pixel-wise semantic segmentation
on the Global Surface Water Occurrence (GSWO) dataset
(1984-2019, 30m).

##### Input data

- source: GSWO dataset (from Landsat imagery)
- coverage: 60°S to 80°N
- resolution: 30 m pixels
- input image patches: 512 \* 512 pixels

##### Label

- GSWO (mask land/non-water)
- GRWL (Global River Widths from Landsat): mask rivers
- OSMWL (OpenStreetMap Water Layer): validate rivers & oceans
- HydroLAKES: confirmed lake polygons

##### Manually Corrected\*

- **split connected river–lake systems**
  - far less than 1%
- exclude low-confidence water pixels
  - lt 5% occurrence
  - 30% occurrence for floodplains
- min area 0.03 $km^2$ (about 33 pixels)

##### Model

- simplified loss
- MIoU (Mean Intersection over Union) as metric
- 2 models for normal and floodplain
- t/v/t: 60%/20%/20%

##### Post-processing

- checked area ratio before/after masking
  - if lt 0.8, indicates it's not even likely to be a water body, discard
- overlaid GRWL and OSMWL masks
- removed coastal lakes intersecting ocean boundaries (10m buffer)
- merged outputs of Normal Model and Floodplain Model
